# Trail Travellers API

Trail Travellers is a ride-hailing and travel management system built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).  
The app allows users to book journeys, drivers to be assigned to journeys with vehicles, and admins to manage everything.

## üöÄ Problem Being Solved
In many towns and cities, users face challenges booking safe, reliable, and affordable rides.  
On the other hand, drivers and vehicle owners struggle to get consistent customers.  
Trail Travellers bridges this gap by offering:
- A seamless booking platform for users.
- A transparent system for drivers to manage rides.
- Full oversight for admins to ensure quality and safety.
